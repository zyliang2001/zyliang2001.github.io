About me
======
I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Department of Computational Precision Health at UC Berkeley where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Irene Chen](https://irenechen.net/) and Prof. [Ahmed Alaa](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ahmed-alaa). My research focuses on machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI, and causal inference, with applications to health and medicine.

Prior to Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, where I had the opportunity to work with Prof. [Rahul G. Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/).
