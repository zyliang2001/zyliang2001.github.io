I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Department of Computational Precision Health at UC Berkeley where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ahmed Alaa](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ahmed-alaa) and Prof. [Irene Chen](https://irenechen.net/). My research focuses on machine learning and causal inference, with an emphasis on robust estimation and reliable performance in high-stakes settings such as healthcare.

Before joining Berkeley, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Toronto, where I had the pleasure of working with Prof. [Rahul G. Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/) on research tackling distribution shift.
